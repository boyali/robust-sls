Code needed to reproduce the examples found in [Robust Performance Guarantees for System Level Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10092) by N. Matni and A. Sharma.

The notebook depends on the [SLSpy package](https://github.com/shih-hao-tseng/SLSpy) developed by Shih-Hao Tseng and Jing Shuang Li, see [SLSpy: Python-Based System-Level Controller Synthesis Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12565) for more details.
